	<!-- The p tag stand for PARAGRAPH -->
	<p>But now with this "p" tag, that its 
	block level every section with a tag
	gets its own line</p>

	<p>That is why this are in different lines</p>

	<h4>This is a h4 tag, and now we are going to test the p tag with a lot of text more so we can see it in action</h4>

	<p>But before we see it with large text lets see the &lt;<b>b</b>&gt; tag, this tag is meant to make text bold, but its deprecated now, and this means that is in process of being replaced, and its not recommended, so that's why we are going to be using the &lt;strong&gt; tab, which <strong>does</strong> the same, but in HTML 5 we use something called semantic mark up, which has the intent to make tags more <em>meaningful</em>, and that last tag we used is the &lt;em&gt; tag, that is used to emphasize text, it is the same as the &lt;i&gt; tag. This whole thing about semantic markup is about separiting the stilying from the structure. strong tells the structure and what it means. </p>

		<h4>Paragraph 1</h4>
		<p>World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's 
		countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more 
		than 100 million people from over 30 countries. <span>The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort </span>, blurring 
		the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were 
		civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the 
		only use of nuclear weapons in war.</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Paragraph 2</h4>
	<p>The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide 
	of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender 
	under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese 
	archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its 
	intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by fiat by the Allies and war crimes trials were conducted 
	in the wake of the war both against the Germans and the Japanese.</p>
